  Design principles for dbt charts narrative reports — data-driven documents that
  answer specific questions. Use when creating analyses, investigations, periodic
  reports, or when the user says 'write a report', 'analyze this data', 'create an
  analysis', 'narrative report'. Covers narrative structure, chart selection for reports,
  content writing, and the executive-summary-first pattern. Do NOT use for at-a-glance
  monitoring dashboards (use dct-board-design). Do NOT use for the build-test-iterate
  workflow (use dct-board-build).

# Report Design

Reports are narrative-driven documents that tell a story with data and answer specific questions. They are NOT dashboards.

> Implementing in YAML? Switch to `dct skills board-build` for the build-test-iterate workflow.

## Report vs. Dashboard

| | Report | Dashboard |
|--|--------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Answer a question, tell a story | Monitor status at a glance |
| **Text** | Extensive — narrative + recommendations | Minimal — titles and labels |
| **Charts** | Support the narrative (3-6 typically) | ARE the content |
| **Structure** | Executive summary → analysis → conclusions | KPIs → trends → breakdowns |
| **Interaction** | Read in minutes | Scan in seconds |

If the user needs at-a-glance monitoring, use the `dct-board-design` skill instead.

## Core Principles

1. **Answer the question first** — lead with the conclusion, not the methodology
2. **Every chart serves the narrative** — no chart without explanatory text above it
3. **Tell a story** — setting (context) → conflict (problem/question) → resolution (findings + recommendations)
4. **Be specific** — "Revenue dropped 12% because Region X lost 3 key accounts" not "Revenue decreased"
5. **Professional tone** — direct, concise, active voice

## Metadata Requirement

When producing dbt charts YAML, include `notes` metadata for AI context/search — it
never renders:

- `queries.*.notes`: query purpose
- `charts.*.notes`: what evidence the chart provides
- `variables.*.notes`: filter meaning (if variables are present)
- Layout object `notes` fields (`rows`/`cols`/`grid.items`/`tabs.items`) where section context helps

## Narrative Structure

Every report follows this arc:

```
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   - 2-3 sentences with key findings
   - Recommendation in bold
   - The answer, upfront

2. CONTEXT
   - Time period, scope, data sources
   - Why this analysis was needed

3. ANALYSIS SECTIONS (2-4)
   - Each section: one finding
   - Pattern: State finding → explain significance → show chart evidence
   - Transition between sections

4. CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Numbered, specific, actionable (who/what/when)
   - Quantify expected impact when possible
```

## Chart Selection for Reports

Reports use fewer charts than dashboards. Each must be referenced in the narrative:

| Report Need | Chart Type | Example Narrative |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| The trend that tells the story | `line` | "Revenue has been declining since March" |
| Segments that matter | `bar` | "Region X underperformed by 23%" |
| A key metric | `kpi` | "Total impact: $2.3M" |
| Detailed breakdown | `table` | "Here are the top 10 affected accounts" |
| Composition change | `area` (stacked) | "The product mix shifted toward lower-margin items" |

**Prefer:** Fewer charts with more text. Tables for evidence. KPIs for anchoring key numbers.

**Avoid:** Many KPIs in a row (dashboard pattern). Charts without narrative context. Interactive filters (reports present a specific analysis).

## Writing Content

Use `text:` blocks in YAML for narrative text (Markdown).

**Opening each section:**
- State the finding first
- Explain why it matters
- Introduce the chart

**Closing each section:**
- Summarize the implication
- Transition to the next section

**Tone guidelines:**
- Active voice: "Revenue declined" not "A decline was observed"
- Specific numbers: "12% decline" not "significant decrease"
- No filler: Cut "It's worth noting that..." — just note it
- Honest about uncertainty where data doesn't fully support a claim

## YAML Structure for Reports

Reports use heavier `text:` usage than dashboards:

```yaml
title: "Q3 Revenue Analysis"
source: warehouse

queries:
  revenue_trend:
    sql: SELECT month, revenue FROM monthly_revenue ORDER BY month

charts:
  trend:
    query: revenue_trend
    type: line
    x: month
    y: revenue

rows:
  - text: |
      ## Executive Summary
      Q3 revenue declined 12% quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily
      by the loss of three enterprise accounts in the West region.
      **Recommendation: Prioritize retention program for accounts >$100K ARR.**

  - text: |
      ## Revenue Trend
      Monthly revenue peaked in June and has declined each month since.
  - trend

  - text: |
      ## Conclusions
      1. Launch retention program for enterprise accounts by end of month
      2. Investigate West region account manager capacity
```

Key differences from dashboard YAML:
- Heavy `text:` blocks with narrative
- Fewer charts (3-6), more text
- No `variables:` — reports present a specific analysis
- Top-level flow follows the narrative arc

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Answers the question in the executive summary
- [ ] Executive summary comes first (conclusion before methodology)
- [ ] Every chart has narrative context above it
- [ ] Findings are specific (numbers, percentages, comparisons)
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable (who/what/when)
- [ ] Story flows logically section to section
- [ ] Appropriate length (3-6 analysis sections)
- [ ] Professional tone (direct, specific, active voice)
- [ ] Query/chart/layout/variable `notes` metadata is filled for AI context

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Methodology before conclusions | Lead with the answer — executives read top-down |
| Chart without narrative context | Every chart needs explanatory text above it |
| Vague findings ("revenue decreased") | Be specific: "revenue declined 12% QoQ" |
| Dashboard patterns in a report (KPI row) | Reports use narrative flow, not monitoring layout |
| Too many charts | 3-6 max — each must serve the story |
| Hedging without reason | Be confident where data supports it |

## Rationalizations to Resist

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "User wants the methodology first" | They don't. They want the answer. Methodology can follow. |
| "Adding more charts shows thoroughness" | It shows clutter. Every chart must serve the narrative. |
| "I'll add filters so they can explore" | That's a dashboard. Reports present a specific analysis. |
| "The data speaks for itself" | It never does. Interpret it — that's the report's job. |
